I see no reason to limit language based on, yes, religious bias. Because the only reason these words have been deemed as curse words originally is because of Christian and Catholic views. If you research the origins of most ""bad words"", you'll realize most of them either don't make sense with how they came about and have been warped into a ""swear word"" overtime due to religious influence, or simply weren't even swear words at all to begin with. I even did a study on this as a side project on the evolution of language. As long as there's no malicious intent behind it, and you don't even need swear words to be malicious, we've come up with plenty ""replacements"" like Frick and Darn, then I see no issue. Of course, this is a person opinion and I am by no means obligating anyone to agree with me, but to insist that ""swear words are bad because they're swear words"" is a logical fallacy.",1 year ago,@PinkSlimeBlebo,UCPTaV2fiFS_oHKC2veKlWIA,26jAfFJkAbI
