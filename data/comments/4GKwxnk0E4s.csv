UgxifAgO4E3k7Yu5Fh14AaABAg,This is great! I was just there in September and want to go back soon! In Seoul we stayed in the Lotte City Hotel in Myeongdong. It was kind of away from all the busy streets but central to everything. We were able to walk most attractions we wanted to go to. We took the bus from the airport and it was great bcuz they store your bags and the seats were so comfortable so you can sleep.We got money exchanged before we went there at our bank. It was good since you needed cash to fill up the Tmoney cars at the stations. I also fell in love with Busan and all their beaches. I think I would love to live there. We stayed at the Paradise Hotel which is pricey but so worth it. We were right at the beach.,2 months ago (edited),@Jb22722,UCMmquXR11j-eqwA1t5jNAAw,4GKwxnk0E4s

Ugxcc6o41J7MqQoyt9F4AaABAg,I just came across your channel and I loved everything about it! I've just suscribed. Although this year will be my 2nd trip to Korea (last year I went to get corrective eye vision surgery only to find out I was not a good candidate) I didn't really get to see much of Korea. This time I'm going with a friend who's super excited to be going. I will use all of these tips and watch your other vlog on what to eat while I'm there. Thanks again 🙏🏼,2 months ago,@dmoral465,UCmTv0RmAbw7YO7MnwYqsfvw,4GKwxnk0E4s
